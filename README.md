🌾 AgriData Explorer: Understanding Indian Agriculture


📌 Project Overview

AgriData Explorer is a data-driven project aimed at analyzing Indian agriculture trends.
It combines Python (EDA & data cleaning), SQL (queries for insights), and Power BI (interactive dashboards) to uncover insights on crop production, yield efficiency, and cultivated area across states and districts of India.

🔑 Key Features

✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python, Pandas, NumPy)

✅ SQL Database Integration (Crop production, yield, and area stats)

✅ Interactive Power BI Dashboard with:

🗺️ India Map (state & district level) showing crop yield & production

📊 Trend Analysis (Yearly crop production growth)

🌍 Crop Comparisons (Rice vs Wheat vs Maize, etc.)

🔍 Filters & Slicers (Crop type, year, region)

📈 KPI Cards (Overall yield, production, efficiency)

✅ Dynamic Titles & Navigation 

🗂 Dataset

Source: ICRISAT (Indian agriculture statistics)

Data Points:

Yearly crop area, production, and yield

Crops: Rice, Wheat, Maize, Cotton, Millets, Soybean, Oilseeds, etc.

Coverage: All Indian states & districts

Format: CSV → Cleaned in Python → Stored in SQL → Visualized in Power BI

🚀 How to Use

Clone this repo:
git clone https://github.com/Thariga-yuvi/AgriData-Explorer-Understanding-Indian-agriculture-with-EDA

Open Power BI file (AgriData_Explorer.pbix) in Power BI Desktop.

Use slicers to filter by crop, state, or year.

Explore SQL queries (/sql folder) for backend analysis.

Run Python notebooks for data cleaning & additional EDA.

📌 Key Insights

Cotton production has shown steady growth in top 5 producing states.

Correlation between cultivated area and production is strong for rice & wheat.

Some states achieve higher yield with smaller area, indicating efficiency.

Oilseed and soybean production trends highlight regional specialization.
